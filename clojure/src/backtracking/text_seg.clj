;;; In the worst case, `splittable` explores each of 2^(n-1) possiblities of
;;; a string of length n. (pp. 85)
;;; A set of words considered acceptable and a function that checks if an
;;; input string is indeed an acceptable word.  Note the definition of `word`
;;; can vary a lot. In this case, a `word` is just an English word, but it
;;; can also be a palindrome, 5-letter word, noun, verb, etc.
